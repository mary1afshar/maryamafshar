              Hello! My name is Maryam Afshar, and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science
              student at the University of Waterloo ðŸ’»
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Through hackathons, previous work experience at Konrad Group, RBC and personal
              projects, I have collected valuable experience working in
              front-end and general software development. Design and development have
              given me the opportunity to express myself by creating
              applications that help in user productivityâœ¨ I'm currently
              seeking Winter 2023 internships!
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              In my free time you can find me reading Colleen Hoover novels, diving,
              filming YouTube videos or swimming :){" "}
