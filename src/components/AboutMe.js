              Hello! My name is Maryam Afshar, and I'm a 2B Computer Science
              student at the University of WaterlooðŸ’»
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Through hackathons, previous work experience at RBC and personal
              projects, I have collected valuable experience working in
              front-end and software development. Design and development have
              given me the opportunity to express myself by creating
              applications that help in user productivityâœ¨ I'm currently
              seeking Winter 2023 internships!
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              In my free time you can find me reading Colleen Hoover novels,
              filming YouTube videos, planning a trip or swimming :){" "}
