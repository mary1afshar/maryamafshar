                        Hello! My name is Maryam Afshar, and I'm a 2B Computer Science student at the University of WaterlooðŸ’»
                        Through hackathons, previous work experience at RBC and personal projects, I have collected 
                        valuable experience working in front-end and software development.
                        Design and development have given me the opportunity to express myself 
                        by creating applications that help in user productivityâœ¨ 
                        I'm currently seeking for Winter 2023 internships!
                        </p>
